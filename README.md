# battery_reporter_linux
Simple Notifier When Battery is less or is getting overcharged
Only Requirement for this is acpi
So for meeting everything up run python3 requirements.py
and then you can run python3 script.py
In Future my goal is to 
- send notification to mobile but i am unable to do it.
- Here is An Alternative for this that is sending mail, but i personally don't like it.
- system independent
- proper software so that it don't require do anything with gui
- Automatic switch to charging to discharging mode and vice versa ( maybe not for windows but may be for linux).(it might be not possible as it is hardware dependent).
